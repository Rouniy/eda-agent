"""A caller must be able to bound its own wait on a modal-prone command.

The progress heartbeat is written ONCE per request by the Pascal dispatcher
and deleted after the response -- it is a presence marker, not a tick. So a
handler parked on a modal Altium dialog looks exactly like one making slow
progress, and the poll loop extended the deadline the full 30 times (300 s)
before failing, then blamed a "stuck handler" and told the user to restart
the script. The script was fine; a dialog was open.
